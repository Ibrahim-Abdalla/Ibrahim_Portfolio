      <description>Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 8K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job. Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium Engineered features from the text of each job * description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. Built a client facing API using flask    Link to GitHub repository</description>

      <description>Created a machine learning algorithm, which is able to predict if a customer will buy again. Preprocessed the data set by balanced, standardized and shuffled the data. Applied deep learning model by using Keras methods that built into the core of tensorflow. Obtained the probability for a customer to convert.    Link to GitHub repository</description>

      <description>I used Hierarchical clustering and K-Means clustering for segmentation. Then applied dimensionality reduction by combining k-means with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify the problem and get better results. Lastly, I calculated correlation between original variables and components to determine the most important ones.

      <title>Project I: The Best Fit Regression Model For Housing Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://Ibrahim-Abdalla.github.io/Ibrahim_Portfolio/post/project-1/</link>

      <description>When looking for the best fit model for prediction, finding the right algorithm has always proven to be the difference between the success and failure of the entire project. Using the Airbnb housing dataset, I created a model that uses selected features of a listing to predict its price. Three different regression models; linear regression, random forest and XGBoost were built, optimized using GridSearchCV, and compared to find the best fit model.</description>
